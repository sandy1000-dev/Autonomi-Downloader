//! Adaptive concurrency controller for client data operations.
//!
//! Replaces hard-coded `quote_concurrency` / `store_concurrency` /
//! download fan-out with a per-channel AIMD limiter that ramps up when
//! the network is healthy and ramps down on stress signals (timeouts,
//! errors, latency inflation). The goal is to give every machine and
//! every connection profile a single client codebase that finds its
//! own steady state without the user tweaking flags.
//!
//! ## Channels
//!
//! Three independent limiters share the same algorithm but track state
//! separately, because their workloads have different cost profiles:
//!
//! - `quote`  — small DHT request/response messages, cheap per op
//! - `store`  — multi-MB chunk PUTs to a close group, expensive per op
//! - `fetch`  — multi-MB chunk GETs from peers, asymmetric to `store`
//!
//! ## Algorithms
//!
//! Quote and store use TCP-style AIMD with slow-start:
//!
//! - **Slow-start**: starting concurrency doubles after each healthy
//!   window until first stress signal or until the configured ceiling.
//! - **Steady state**: additive +1 per healthy window (>= success_target
//!   success rate AND p95 latency within `latency_inflation_factor` of
//!   the rolling baseline).
//! - **Stress**: multiplicative decrease (current / 2, floor 1) on any
//!   of: success rate < success_target, timeout rate > timeout_ceiling,
//!   or p95 latency above `latency_inflation_factor * baseline`.
//!
//! Decisions evaluate over a sliding window of the last `window_ops`
//! observed outcomes per channel. Below `min_window_ops` outcomes the
//! controller holds steady — too few samples to act on.
//!
//! Fetch uses a throughput-seeking hill climber instead. It measures
//! bytes/sec over epochs, probes nearby concurrency values, accepts
//! higher caps only when goodput improves materially, and accepts lower
//! caps when goodput is effectively unchanged. Stress signals still cut
//! concurrency immediately.
//!
//! ## What this is not
//!
//! - Not a payment-batching controller. Wave / batch sizes are
//!   orthogonal (gas-economics tradeoff, not throughput).
//! - Not a persistent peer-quality scorer. Bootstrap cache scoring was
//!   removed from saorsa-core; this controller only tunes client
//!   concurrency.
