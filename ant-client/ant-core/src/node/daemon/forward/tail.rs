//! Following a node's log files as they are written and rotated.
//!
//! ant-node rotates **daily by filename** (`ant-node.YYYY-MM-DD.log`) and prunes to
//! `--log-max-files`, so "rotation" here is a new file appearing beside the old one rather than a
//! cursor moving — which makes the tailer's job mostly bookkeeping over a sorted file list.
//!
//! Two behaviours are worth knowing about before reading the code:
//!
//! - **A partially written line is never emitted.** Only bytes up to the last newline in a chunk
//!   are consumed, so an event that is still being written is picked up whole on the next poll.
//! - **A multi-line event is not split across polls.** The last event of a chunk is held back and
//!   the stored offset stays at its first byte, so its continuation lines — a panic and its
//!   backtrace, most importantly — join it rather than becoming orphans. It is released once the
//!   file stops growing.
